# Abacus

A personal finance dashboard that pulls a user's bank data from Plaid and helps them build a Conscious Spending Plan from it.

## Language

### Bank data

**Plaid item**:
One login at one institution that a user has connected through Plaid. It holds one or more accounts.
_Avoid_: Connection, link, institution

**Account**:
A single bank, card or investment account within a Plaid item, with its latest balances.
_Avoid_: Plaid account (outside code that talks to Plaid directly)

**Selected account**:
The account the user is currently viewing, remembered across pages and visits. Home and a new spending plan setup both start from it.
_Avoid_: Current account, active account

**Recurring stream**:
A payment or deposit Plaid has detected repeating on an account, such as a bill or a paycheck.
_Avoid_: Recurring transaction, subscription

### Keeping data current

**Item linking**:
Connecting a new Plaid item, or reconnecting an existing one, and storing its access for later syncs.
_Avoid_: Onboarding, token exchange

**Item sync**:
Bringing a Plaid item's stored accounts, transactions and recurring streams up to date with Plaid. It runs when an item is linked and when Plaid notifies us of changes.
_Avoid_: Refresh, backfill, import

### Spending plan

**Spending plan**:
A user's monthly Conscious Spending Plan (Ramit Sethi's method): take-home pay split across four buckets, with whatever is left as guilt-free spending. A user has at most one saved plan.
_Avoid_: Budget

**Bucket**:
One of the plan's four places for money: fixed costs, investments, savings or guilt-free spending. The first three hold lines; guilt-free spending is what's left after them. Each transaction's money lands in one bucket, except money that only moves between the user's own accounts, pay coming in, and credit card payments, which don't count toward any.
_Avoid_: Plan part, category (that's Plaid's word for transactions)

**Line**:
A named amount within a bucket, such as "Rent/mortgage" or "401(k)".
_Avoid_: Row, entry

**Breakdown item**:
One of the amounts a line can be split into, such as each insurance policy under "Insurance". It may come from a recurring stream. When a line has breakdown items, its amount is their sum.
_Avoid_: Item on its own (clashes with Plaid item), sub-line

**Take-home pay**:
What lands in the user's account each month after taxes and paycheck deductions.
_Avoid_: Income, salary, net pay

**Paycheck contribution**:
An investment line taken out of the paycheck before it's deposited, like most 401(k)s.
_Avoid_: Pre-tax deduction

**Plan income**:
Take-home pay plus paycheck contributions. Every bucket's share is measured against it.
_Avoid_: Income, gross income

**Fixed-cost buffer**:
A percentage added on top of fixed costs to cover forgotten and rising costs. It defaults to 15%.
_Avoid_: Miscellaneous, padding

**Guilt-free spending**:
Plan income minus the other three buckets. It's negative when the plan spends more than it has.
_Avoid_: Discretionary, leftover, fun money

**Target**:
The suggested share of plan income for a bucket, such as 50–60% for fixed costs.
_Avoid_: Goal, limit

**Flagged**:
A plan outcome that needs the user's attention: fixed costs above their target, or guilt-free spending below zero.
_Avoid_: Over budget, warning

**Sorting**:
Deciding each transaction's bucket, using the user's plan lines as a guide, so a streaming charge lands in fixed costs when the plan lists subscriptions there. New transactions are sorted after each item sync, and every transaction is sorted again when a save changes the plan's lines.
_Avoid_: Categorizing, classifying
