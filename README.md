# Abacus

A personal finance dashboard for connecting bank accounts and viewing account balances in one place.

Abacus is in early development. The current integration uses Plaid Sandbox.

## Features

- Sign in with Clerk.
- Connect financial accounts through Plaid Link.
- View connected account details, current balances, and available balances.
- Store user and account connections in PostgreSQL.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, PrimeVue 5
- **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 with Flyway migrations
- **Integrations:** Clerk for authentication and Plaid for financial account data

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.18+ within v22, or 24.12+; npm
- Java 17
- Docker with Docker Compose
- Clerk and Plaid Sandbox credentials

### 1. Start the database

From the repository root:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Configure and start the backend

```sh
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the Clerk and Plaid values in `.env`. Configure the token encryption keyset
using the [encryption setup guide](docs/plaid-token-encryption.md).
The database defaults match the local Docker Compose configuration.

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8080/api`. Flyway creates the schema on a fresh database.

The initial migrations may change during pre-production development. If you have
already run older versions, reset the local database before restarting the backend.
From the repository root:

```sh
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
```

This deletes all local database data. Plain `docker compose down` keeps the named
volume and its tables.

### 3. Configure and start the frontend

In a separate terminal, create `frontend/.env` with:

```dotenv
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

Use the same Clerk application configured for the backend, then run:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` to sign in and connect a sandbox account.
